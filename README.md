Honey Style is a lightweight, modular CSS-in-JS solution for React designed to give you full control over styling with minimal runtime overhead.

Inspired by libraries like styled-components, Honey Style provides:

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Runtime style injection using a single `<style>` tag.
- üß† Style deduplication and usage tracking for efficient memory and performance.
- üé® ClassName hashing and scoping to avoid collisions.
- üõ†Ô∏è Typed style props and responsive utilities.

It's built for design systems, scalable UI libraries, or developers who want a transparent and customizable styling layer without magic.
